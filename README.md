# Unix
This is a simple guessing game that I made in UNIX
The computer selecta a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess the number.
The program will prompt the user each time a number is entered letting them know if that number was too high or too low until the number is guessed correctly.
Instructions are displayed as the game runs, along with errors if the users input doesnt meet the required specifications
